[descriptions]
Description = This model describes a simple gene expression for mRNA and protein driven by a constitutive promoter with constant mRNA synthesis rate. An additional term is considered to account for the maturation of the protein. 

Definition of states =
	m: mRNA
	p: peptide/protein
	p_mat: matured protein

Definition of parameters =
	synm: mRNA synthesis rate
	degm: mRNA degradation rate
	synp: protein synthesis rate
	degp: protein degradation rate/dilution rate
	k_mat: protein maturation rate 

Definition of inputs =
