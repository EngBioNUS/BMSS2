[descriptions]
Description = This model describes the gene expression for mRNA and protein driven by an inducible promoter. There is possibly a degradation of extracellular inducer followed by delay in induction due to active transport.
	inde: extracellular inducer concentration
	indi: intracellular inducer concentration
	m: mRNA
	p: peptide/protein

Definition of parameters =
	vm: transport rate
	n_trans: hill coefficient for transport
	k_trans: half-activation constant for transport
	degind: degradation rate of inducer
	n: hill coefficient
	k_ind: half-activation constant
	synm: mRNA synthesis rate
	degm: mRNA degradation rate
	synp: protein synthesis rate
	degp: protein degradation rate/dilution rate

Definition of inputs =
	[]
