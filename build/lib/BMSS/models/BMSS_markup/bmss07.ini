Description = This model describes a simple gene expression for protein driven by an inducible promoter with constant induction.

Definition of states =
	p: peptide/protein

Definition of parameters =
	n: hill coefficient
	k_ind: half-activation constant
	synp: protein synthesis rate
	degp: protein degradation rate/dilution rate

Definition of inputs =
	ind: inducer level
