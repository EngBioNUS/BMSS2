[descriptions]
Description = This model describes a simple gene expression for mRNA and protein driven by an inducible promoter with constant induction.

Definition of states=
	m: mRNA
	p: protein

Definition of parameters= 
	k_ind: half-activation constant
	synm: mRNA synthesis rate
	degm: mRNA degradation rate
	synp: protein synthesis rate
	degp: protein degradation rate/dilution rate

Definition of inputs=
	ind: inducer level
