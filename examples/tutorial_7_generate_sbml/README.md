__This tutorial includes three different functions__

1. To generate SBML files from the model database:
	- Running only the function will bring up 2 prompts.
	- First prompt indicates which model you would like to generate the SBML file.
	- If there are model settings available, second prompt indicates which setting you would like to use to generate the SBML file.

2. To generate SBML files from a list of configuration files:
	- Running only this function will generate SBML files from single/multiple .ini files"
	- Use this if you want to only convert selected files from the whole folder.

3. To autogenerate SBML files for all .ini files stored inside any folderpath (e.g., ConfigSBML folder for this tutorial)
	- Running this function will generate the corresponding SBML files for all .ini files stored in ConfigSBML folder.
	- Note: Ensure that all .ini files are in correct format or the function will terminate with error.
