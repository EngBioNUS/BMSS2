[descriptions]
Description = This model describes gene expressions for an OR logic gate. The ODEs include the dynamics of the proteins and the corresponding mRNAs driven by two inputs. The inducer for input 1 is assumed to have delay in induction whereas the inducer for input 2 is assumed to be slowly degrading over time. Resource competition is assumed to cause reduction in protein synthesis rate in the presence of both input 1 and 2 (state = 11).  

Definition of states =
	Inde: extracellular inducer concentration
	Indi: intracellular inducer concentration
	Ind: Inducer dynamics
	mRNA1: mRNA of p1
	Pep1: peptide/protein 1
	mRNA2: mRNA of p2
	Pep2: peptide/protein 2
	mRNA3: mRNA of p3
	Pep3: peptide/protein 3

Definition of parameters =
	synmRNA1: mRNA synthesis rate for protein 1
	synmRNA2: mRNA synthesis rate for protein 2
	synmRNA3: mRNA synthesis rate for protein 3
	deg_mRNA: mRNA degradation rate
	syn_Pep: protein synthesis rate
	deg_Pep: protein degradation rate/dilution rate
	Pepmax: normalization constant
	Km: half-activation for active transport
	deg_Ind: inducer degradation rate
	Ratio: Reduction capacity when both inputs are ON. 

Definition of inputs =
	state1: input1 to control p1 expression
	state2: input2 to control p2 expression
