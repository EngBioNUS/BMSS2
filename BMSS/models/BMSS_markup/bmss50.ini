[descriptions]
Description = This model is to capture the growth profile with mortality phase. A crowded habitat depleted of resources and polluted by discarded metabolites could not support a large population indefinitely, thus the population may decline at some point instead of reaching stationary phase.
	

Definition of states =
	OD: optical density of the bacterial cells

Definition of parameters =
	N0: initial number or cell density
	m1: steepness of the growth phase
	m2: steepness of the mortality phase
	tc1: the characteristic time of the exponential growth had it been unimpeded
	tc2: the characteristic time of the mortality stage

Definition of inputs =
	t: time
